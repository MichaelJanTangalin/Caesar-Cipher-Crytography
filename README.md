# Caesar Cipher Cryptography Project  

This python project demonstrates the **Caesar Cipher** algorithm implemented in **two versions**:  
1. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** version  
2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** version using Tkinter  

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.
